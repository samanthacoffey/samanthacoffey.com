          <p>I'm a former paralegal and self-taught programmer. I have more than than 4 years of experience working in an administrative capacity and expertly providing support to teams. Aside from a passion for programming, I love languages, traveling, and spending time with my friends and family. I'm currently looking for career opportunities where my excellent writing skills are welcome and where I can continue improve my programming skills on the job.</p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>I'm currently taking numerous online courses in the hope of improving my programming skills. I have a solid foundation in HTML5 and CSS3, I'm taking an active interest in learning how to use Sass and other CSS pre-compilers, working through numerous textbooks on Javascript and jQuery, and taking an online course in Python. I love using frameworks such as Bootstrap to craft simple and responsive websites. Aside from my burgeoning skills in computer programming and web development, I honed verbal and written communication skills working as a paralegal at an elite law firm, and at internships working in New York State government. With an undergraduate academic background in Religion, Classics, Languages, and Linguistics, I feel comfortable forming my thoughts and expressing my ideas.</p>
